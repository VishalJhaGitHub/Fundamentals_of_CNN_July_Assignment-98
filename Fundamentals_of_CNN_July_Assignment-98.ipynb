    "\n",
    "#Ans\n",
    "\n",
    "#Object Detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "#1 - Object detection involves identifying and localizing multiple objects within an image or a video frame.\n",
    "#2 - It provides both the class label of the object and its precise location in the image, usually in the form of a bounding box.\n",
    "#3 - Object detection is used when you want to detect and locate multiple objects of interest in an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Detecting and localizing multiple objects in a street scene, such as cars, pedestrians, and traffic lights, with bounding boxes around each.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Object Classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "#1 - Object classification is the task of assigning a single class label to an entire image.\n",
    "#2 - It doesn't provide information about the location of objects within the image, only the category or class they belong to.\n",
    "#3 - Object classification is used when the goal is to categorize the entire image, often used for tasks like image categorization or scene recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Classifying an entire image of a beach scene as \"beach\" without specifying the presence or location of individual objects like umbrellas or people."
